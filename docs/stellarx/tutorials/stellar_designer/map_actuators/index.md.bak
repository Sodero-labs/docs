### Step 3: Actuator Mapping & Configuration

In the previous section, we completed the modeling of the ideal robot's kinematics and dynamics. Now, we need to map this theoretical model to the physical drivers in the real world: the **Actuators**.

For this guide, we will use **Synapticon's JD8 and JD10** actuators as examples, demonstrating the configuration process with gear reducers attached.

#### 1. Check Initial Status
Since joints requiring actual actuation were added in the previous "Robot Structure" step, you will see actuator nodes and joint nodes generated upon entering the **Actuator Mapping** page, as shown below. Currently, they are in an **Unlinked** state.

#### 2. Input Motor Information
Each actuator consists of two key elements: "Motor Information" and "EtherCAT Settings." First, click **[Motor Information]** to begin configuration.

*(Image: "Motor Information" highlighted with a box)*

Enter the motor's physical specifications into the input fields that activate on the right panel. These values can usually be found in the **Specification Sheet** provided by the motor manufacturer.
* *Note: Since the Gear Ratio will be handled in a separate step later, please focus solely on the specifications of the motor itself here.*

#### 3. Configure EtherCAT Settings
Next is **[EtherCAT Settings]**, which defines the communication with the servo driver. While it may appear complex, the essential configuration items are clearly defined.

**A. SDO Settings (Initialization Parameters)**
* **Absolute Encoder:** The register address for absolute encoder settings varies by manufacturer. Verify the correct address and enter it into **SDO Entry 1**.
    * **Note:** This object is typically used to clear absolute encoder errors. These errors commonly occur when the multi-turn encoder battery is missing or depleted (low voltage). Ensure you configure this object to handle such initialization states correctly.

    You can identify the relevant object in your driver's manual and input it as shown below.

**B. PDO Mapping (Real-time Data)**
PDO (Process Data Object) refers to data exchanged periodically for real-time control. Instead of using the fixed mapping assigned by the manufacturer, we use the **User-Defined Mapping** method to select and communicate only the necessary data.

* **RxPDO (Controller → Driver):** This is the dataset containing commands sent from the master to the driver. If the driver complies with the **CiA402 Standard Profile**, it must include the items below. If even one item is missing, the control algorithm may not function correctly.
    * `Control Word`, `Target Position`, `Target Torque`, `Torque Offset`, `Mode of Operation`

* **TxPDO (Driver → Controller):** This is the feedback dataset where the driver reports its current status to the master. For precise control, the following status values must be received without omission.
    * `Status Word`, `Position/Velocity/Torque Actual Value`, `Mode of Operation Display`

> **⚠️ Caution: Verify PDO Mapping Indices**
> Although indices such as `0x1600` or `0x1700` are commonly used for **RxPDO**, and `0x1A00` or `0x1B00` for **TxPDO**, these addresses are not universal.
>
> You must strictly refer to the manual of the servo driver you are using to confirm the correct **User-Defined Mapping** address space. Using a manufacturer-reserved area or an incorrect index will result in errors during EtherCAT application.
>
> *For example, Synapticon documentation specifies `0x1600` and `0x1A00` for user configurable mapping:*
