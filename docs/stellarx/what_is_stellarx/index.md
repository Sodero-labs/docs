# What is StellarX?

StellarX is Sodero's motion-control platform for building, testing, and deploying motion solutions with consistent, deterministic performance. It pairs tightly integrated hardware with a software stack that simplifies the transition from prototyping to production.

- **Purpose-built motion controller**: Real-time control designed for precise, synchronized motion across multi-axis systems.
- **Deterministic communications**: Low-latency networking between controller, drives, and peripherals to keep motion sequences aligned.
- **Developer-focused tooling**: Configuration, tuning, and monitoring tools streamline setup and debugging so you spend more time iterating on motion profiles.
- **Modular architecture**: Scales from single-axis setups to coordinated, multi-controller networks without rethinking your approach.
